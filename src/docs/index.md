Welcome!

This project exists for developers to get Hypixel data in an easier way.

## Data Sources

- **Hypixel API** \
  Data is automatically pulled from Hypixel resource endpoints! However, the data provided here is not comprehensive, so the other sources help with gaps.

- **Hypixel Wiki** \
  Data is periodically loaded in from the official [Hypixel Wiki](https://wiki.hypixel.net). This is where the vast majority of value comes from, as Hypixel typically automatically updates a lot of properties on the wiki that just aren't available anywhere else.

- **NotEnoughUpdates REPO** \
  Some data is loaded from the [NEU-REPO](https://github.com/NotEnoughUpdates/NotEnoughUpdates-REPO). Right now, only skull textures that are missing from the Hypixel API are loaded from it, though this might expand.

- **Manual Overrides / Scripts** \
  Any missing or misc data is loaded through manual overrides and scripts made in the [RepoOverrides](https://github.com/SkyblockRepo/RepoOverrides) github repository. If you want to contribute to the repo this might be where you start.
